Functional programming has helped me achieving a rigorous attitude towards programming.
Not only that, it also helped me to maintain a watchful attitude when handling machines I maintain.</p><h3>Skills</h3><ul><li>Linux Administration: Professionally, I maintain a few Debian machines for testing and productions while using Arch Linux for my
day-to-day operating system (7 years and counting).</li><li>Windows Administration: I also maintain Windows boxes for a living. From servers to normal desktops.</li><li>PTC Windchill: I maintain PTC Windchill deployments for almost 3 years from version 9 to 10.</li><li>Functional Programming: I really like what Haskell offers when it comes to correctness.</li><li>IIOT: From mid-2017, I have responsibilities to write and maintain backend programs for IIOT projects which usually use standard protocols.</li><li>Soft Skills: I'm capable of writing, reading, and speaking in English at professional level. While I'm still learning Dutch, I'm confident that at the end of 2018, I will be able to read Dutch in professional level. For mother tongue, I speak Indonesian and Javanese for my verbal and written communications.</li></ul><h3>Education</h3><ul><li><i>Universitas Sebelas Maret Surakarta, Technology Information, Thesis Data-mining related project.</i></li></ul><h3>Technical Work Experience</h3><ul><li>Parametrik Solusi Integrasi (2015 - ...)</li></ul>
