Using Mutable Global Variable

Or perhaps you can call it a black magic.

Last night, a friend asked me whether I have ever used global variable
in my programs.
Surely I sent him a link from [Haskell wiki](https://wiki.haskell.org/Top_level_mutable_state#A_variant:_use_.22deriving.22_clauses)
wrote a simple [POC](https://gitlab.com/ibnuda/SaltedEgg) within a web server
context.

Truth to be told, I actually tried to implement it once for one of my `$WORK`'s
project but decided to not to because I was scared man.
I was scared because I don't know what actually happens under the hood
of `unsafePerformIO`.

To be continued.
