Ayyy! New Site!

Finally I have my own site.
Having a personal site was one of a few things that I-wish-I-had-but-hadn't

There are a few components of this site.

### Domain

Truth to be told, this site is a badly done pun from "siskamling",
"Sistem Keamanan Lingkungan".
Even until now, I'm not really sure why did I choose this stupid pun as the domain.

But let me look at the brighter side.
`link` tlds are relatively cheaper compared to the other domain.
Just by, approximately, US$11, I can have this shitty pun-site for a year!

Well, it actually is not really cheaper. ðŸ˜­
But it has pun, damn it!

### Hosting

I use the same provider for this shared hosting as this site's domain seller.
I bought the cheapest plan for 2 years.
Look, when you have 99% text content, and minimalist site,
it's the smartest plan you know.
US$7 a year, 300mb disk storage, unlimited transfer bandwidth,
and featureful cpanel.
Nice!

Oh oh oh, **Let's Encrypt** is supported! Nice!

### Web Pages

I generate this site using [this](https://gitlab.com/ibnuda/ibnuda.gitlab.io) stupid
ass blog engine. I've written about it on the other post.

Look, I really do think that in my case, where what I do produce mostly is just text,
I have a moral obligation to lower the power consumption for this site's operationals.
I don't want to spend millions of cpu cycles just to parse CSS and PHP on server and
users' side.
I dislike visual noises, and when I want to read something, I just want to see text not
some background picture or `hero` bullshit.
No offense to people who love bullshit like that, tho.

Also, this site uses less than 10kb of css and js.
Not that I wrote it myself, but surely it feels good to have minimalistic site.
<small>Psst... I just shamelessly copied it from PureCSS' example.</small>

#### Update for a while
Just like bonsai, the blog engine changes through time.
I added something there, removed another thing here, etc.
Now it's just a stupidly boring site.
(But there's an RSS feed!)

### Contents

I don't know, perhaps it's the result of my own mental masturbation.
