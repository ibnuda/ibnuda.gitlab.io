My name is Ibnu D. Aji. I don't know what am I doing most of the time.
This blog is where I write (mostly) technical stuff that I (rarely) have the will to do so.

If you really really really want to contact me, just look [here](2018-04-25-contact.html).

Oh, by the way, if you want to edit this site, just push one or two pull reqs to
this [repo](https://gitlab.com/ibnuda/ibnuda.gitlab.io)
