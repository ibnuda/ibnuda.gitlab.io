### Summary

I'm a System Administrator and Backend Programmer with experience in using Haskell, both professionally and for hobbies.
Functional programming has helped me achieving a rigorous attitude towards programming.
Not only that, it also helped me to maintain a watchful attitude when handling machines I maintain. 

### Skills

- Linux Administration: Professionally, I maintain a few Debian machines for testing and productions while using Arch Linux for my
  day-to-day operating system (7 years and counting).
- Windows Administration: I also maintain Windows boxes for a living. From servers to normal desktops.
- PTC Windchill: I maintain PTC Windchill deployments for almost 3 years from version 9 to 10.
- Functional Programming: I really like what Haskell offers when it comes to correctness.
- IIOT: From mid-2017, I have responsibilities to write and maintain backend programs for IIOT projects which usually use standard protocols.
- Soft Skills: I'm capable of writing, reading, and speaking in English at professional level.
