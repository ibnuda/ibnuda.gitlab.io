Do I Need Machine Learning?

Truth to be told, I feel nausea when somebody says "It uses machine learning(tm)!"
Even worse when they say, "Let's build blockchain(c) for this bullshit!" I just,
I don't know, tired of it, I guess.
I can't exactly explain why I do feel that way.

For me, I really think that those buzzwords are just glorified statistics, for ML,
and something like `git` but for any data for blockchain.

I know, I know, you will say what I write here is wrong and I'm a retard.
I just don't want to write something too technical for this bullshit.
