2017 Retrospective
2017-12-29 00:00:00 UTC


TL;DR: I think I've burned out at first and then somehow still enjoying the
rest just fine.

## Work
At the first half year, I didn't do much in term of self development. I just did
what I had to do. Other than that, trying to find some timesink side projects.

On the second half, I really like it, and finally, I write Haskell for a living.
Not as a main job-describtion, though. But still, it's really nice.

Learning and implementing stuff while being paid is really nice, to be honest.
Especially when you're in the jungle and know nothing. Shit is so damn cash, mayne!
I don't think I will resign from this job in the near future.

## <del>Timesink</del> Side Toys
I've dabbled a few tech stacks for my side projects. Mainly for web development
and stuff like that. [Freya](https://freya.io), [Suave](https://suave.io), and
[Servant](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant) to name most of it. What
I've gained from dabbling in those frameworks and languages, in a sense, are
mostly about, well, how to build a program with some requirements.
While I do that, I also learned about the underlying theories and techniques.

### Halted Projects
- [Forum](https://gitlab.com/ibnuda/Forum): I've learned most of web dev from
this project. For example:
  - Authorization and authentication: Because there's no easy way to store a
    session in Freya, I did it in JWT. Which in turn, I had to read a lot of
    code to do it correctly (lol, correct).
  - HTTP verbs: For example, `PUT` is usually used for putting
    a resource to the server. In short, just a standard usage of proper http verbs.
  - State Machine: [hephaestus](https://github.com/xyncro/hephaestus), which is
    used by Freya to decide what should be done, is a simple and clear state machine
    library. Though when I want to understand it, I have to read [hekate]
    (https://github.com/xyncro/hekate)'s source code and Erwig's paper because
    of the lacks of documentations.
  - JSON: Again, I use xyncro's library, Chiron, to use JSON in it.
  - Front-end: I don't know. I don't really enjoy front-end. Fortunately, because
    of [elmish](https://github.com/fable-elmish/elmish), it's a bit palatable.
    I guess F# is a boon in my first half of this year.
- [Stasiun](https://gitlab.com/ibnuda/Stasiun): I'm trying to write a flexible
  state machine library which takes inputs from user and then create an object 
  representation of it. The reason I haven't continued it yet is, I feel not competent
  enough, in theoritical sense, to finish it.
- Many other projects. I guess I'm not strong enough to write things in dynamic
  languages. Yeah, I'm sorry Rich, I can't understand Clojure.

### Open Sauce Contributions
Did a few contributions. Not really proud of it, actually. But I'll write it
just for a memento.

- [Marten.FSharp](https://github.com/TheAngryByrd/Marten.FSharp/): just added a few things. (because i needed those things, tbh)
- Few other: Mainly translation or maintenance of little things.

## (Not So) Personal
- Dutch: It's my fourth language that I use, after learning it for approx. a year.
  Pretty simple, compared to English but it's still a long way to master it. Or
  at least fluent in it.
- Cat: Finally I've got myself a pet and named it "Ahsu van Mopi". He came to me
  at the December 4th, near my office. It's nice to play with something when you're
  so tired of many shits.
- Family: I guess I love my youngest sister the most.
