                <h1>Cloning FluxBB (NOT FINISHED YET)</h1><p>Writing a forum software is one of a few things that I-wished-I-have-but-haven't in the last of couple of years.
For example, among a gazillion abandoned repos on this GitLab account, <a href="https://gitlab.com/ibnuda/Forum"><code>Forum</code></a> is one of them.
If you take a glance on it, you will see -- obviously -- that it's an unfinished forum software.</p><p>So, I decided to take a different approach to finally do it, no matter what it takes.
I will use the following tech:</p><ul><li>FluxBB's database structure. Though in this case, it will be mutilated gruesomely.</li><li>Yesod. A great framework with bells and whistles.</li><li>Esqueleto. See, it's nice to join tables in a bar and/or database.</li></ul><h2>Database Design</h2><p>I don't know whether database mutilation breaks 180 KUHP or not.</p><h2>Inner Workings</h2><ul><li>User's story</li><li>Mod's story</li><li>Admin's story</li></ul><h2>Layout and UI</h2><p>No JavaScript, obviously. <small> Because I don't understand it</small></p>
