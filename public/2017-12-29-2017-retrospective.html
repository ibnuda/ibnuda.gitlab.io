TL;DR: I think I&#39;ve burned out at first and then somehow still enjoying the
rest just fine.

                <h1>2017 Retrospective</h1><p>TL;DR: I think I've burned out at first and then somehow still enjoying the
rest just fine.</p><h2>Work</h2><p>At the first half year, I didn't do much in term of self development. I just did
what I had to do. Other than that, trying to find some timesink side projects.</p><p>On the second half, I really like it, and finally, I write Haskell for a living.
Not as a main job-describtion, though. But still, it's really nice.</p><p>Learning and implementing stuff while being paid is really nice, to be honest.
Especially when you're in the jungle and know nothing. Shit is so damn cash, mayne!
I don't think I will resign from this job in the near future.</p><h2><del>Timesink</del> Side Toys</h2><p>I've dabbled a few tech stacks for my side projects. Mainly for web development
and stuff like that. <a href="https://freya.io">Freya</a>, <a href="https://suave.io">Suave</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant">Servant</a> to name most of it. What
I've gained from dabbling in those frameworks and languages, in a sense, are
mostly about, well, how to build a program with some requirements.
While I do that, I also learned about the underlying theories and techniques.</p><h3>Halted Projects</h3><ul><li><a href="https://gitlab.com/ibnuda/Forum">Forum</a>: I've learned most of web dev from
this project. For example:</li><li>Authorization and authentication: Because there's no easy way to store a
session in Freya, I did it in JWT. Which in turn, I had to read a lot of
code to do it correctly (lol, correct).</li><li>HTTP verbs: For example, <code>PUT</code> is usually used for putting
a resource to the server. In short, just a standard usage of proper http verbs.</li><li>State Machine: <a href="https://github.com/xyncro/hephaestus">hephaestus</a>, which is
used by Freya to decide what should be done, is a simple and clear state machine
library. Though when I want to understand it, I have to read [hekate]
(https://github.com/xyncro/hekate)'s source code and Erwig's paper because
of the lacks of documentations.</li><li>JSON: Again, I use xyncro's library, Chiron, to use JSON in it.</li><li>Front-end: I don't know. I don't really enjoy front-end. Fortunately, because
of <a href="https://github.com/fable-elmish/elmish">elmish</a>, it's a bit palatable.
I guess F# is a boon in my first half of this year.</li><li><a href="https://gitlab.com/ibnuda/Stasiun">Stasiun</a>: I'm trying to write a flexible
state machine library which takes inputs from user and then create an object 
representation of it. The reason I haven't continued it yet is, I feel not competent
enough, in theoritical sense, to finish it.</li><li>Many other projects. I guess I'm not strong enough to write things in dynamic
languages. Yeah, I'm sorry Rich, I can't understand Clojure.</li></ul><h3>Open Sauce Contributions</h3><p>Did a few contributions. Not really proud of it, actually. But I'll write it
just for a memento.</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/TheAngryByrd/Marten.FSharp/">Marten.FSharp</a>: just added a few things. (because i needed those things, tbh)</li><li>Few other: Mainly translation or maintenance of little things.</li></ul><h2>(Not So) Personal</h2><ul><li>Dutch: It's my fourth language that I use, after learning it for approx. a year.
Pretty simple, compared to English but it's still a long way to master it. Or
at least fluent in it.</li><li>Cat: Finally I've got myself a pet and named it &quot;Ahsu van Mopi&quot;. He came to me
at the December 4th, near my office. It's nice to play with something when you're
so tired of many shits.</li><li>Family: I guess I love my youngest sister the most.</li></ul>
