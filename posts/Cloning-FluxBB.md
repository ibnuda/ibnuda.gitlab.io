# Cloning FluxBB (UNFINISHED YET)

Writing a forum software is one of a few things that I-wished-I-have-but-haven't in the last of couple of years.
For example, among a gazillion abandoned repos on this GitLab account, [`Forum`](https://gitlab.com/ibnuda/Forum) is one of them.
If you take a glance on it, you will see -- obviously -- that it's an unfinished forum software.

So, I decided to take a different approach to finally do it, no matter what it takes.
I will use the following tech:

- FluxBB's database structure. Though in this case, it will be mutilated gruesomely.
- Yesod. A great framework with bells and whistles.
- Esqueleto. See, it's nice to join tables in a bar and/or database.

## Database Design

I don't know whether database mutilation breaks 180 KUHP or not.

## Inner Workings

- User's story
- Mod's story
- Admin's story

## Layout and UI

No JavaScript, obviously. <small> Because I don't understand it</small>
